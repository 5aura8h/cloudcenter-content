# Infoblox

### Miscellaneous Infoblox integration scripts. Far from complete as-is, but a good working example. In particular, there are probably more parameters required to be printed out to CloudCenter than what are included in these examples.
- Note that the "New" scripts were written later to support an OLDER version of the Infoblox API that doesn't support getting the next available IP along with the create_host call. So couldn't use the python module, so had to write from scratch using python reuqests alone.
